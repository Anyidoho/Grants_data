<AbstractNarration>This award will support a workshop entitled ?Modern methods in microscopy: Elucidating the physical biology of the cell? at the University of Kansas.  This activity will consist of a ten-day hands-on workshop focused on using cutting-edge technology, team building, mentoring by the project team of scientists from underrepresented groups, and follow up support as these scientists from Hispanic-serving Institutions (HIS) scientists prepare NSF proposals.  This workshop will contribute to meeting the national need for a strong, diverse, and inclusive workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop activities will include lectures and hands-on experiences.  Teams consisting of a research faculty director and a scientist from four HSIs will receive training on topics such as calibration and standards, capabilities of bright-field, laser scanning confocal, capFRET, epi-fluorescence microscopy, and imaging ethics.  All members of the workshop and leadership team are from groups underrepresented in STEM.  Participants will learn how to use imaging technologies and resources that greatly advance their research programs that may not be available at their home institutions.  The outcomes of the project will be assessed by the University of Kansas Center for Educational Opportunity Programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
