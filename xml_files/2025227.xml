<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;The Texas Nanofabrication Facility (TNF) will enable research and development in nanoscience and technology, with applications in nanoelectronics/photonics, green energy and healthcare. TNF will provide state-of-the-art capability in nanodevice prototyping, metrology, and nanomanufacturing. This will include, for example, research in nanosensors for the Internet-of-Things, high efficiency solar cells for green energy, and nano drug delivery systems. TNF is the only NNCI node in the southwest region of the US, encompassing Texas and the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. The efforts in prototyping of nanoelectronic devices in the cleanroom will be enabled by training of users by NNCI staff, as well as by staff providing remote services for external users who are unable to travel to TNF. Coupled with device fabrication, TNF will provide cutting-edge tools in nanoscale imaging and metrology at the atomic scale. Located in a vibrant US technology hub in central Texas, TNF will have tremendous impact in nanotechnology education and entrepreneurship, particularly among under-represented minorities such as Hispanics, a sizeable minority in Texas, and Native Americans in Oklahoma. Furthermore, TNF will perform social scientific research to explore the ethical implications of nanotechnology. We will regularly host tours of our cleanroom, research facilities and nanotech labs, and host popular lectures on nanotechnology for K-gray members of the public because education and outreach are critical to creating an informed public, and securing the economic and environmental future of the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;The Texas Nanofabrication Facility (TNF) at the University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin) is composed of the Microelectronics Research Center (MRC), the Texas Materials Institute (TMI), and nanomanufacturing fab (nm-Fab) which collectively house over 130 major tools in 22,000 sq.ft. of labs, staffed by 25 professionals. The MRC cleanroom provides extensive nanofabrication capabilities, TMI provides state-of-the-art metrology tools, while the nm-Fab developes and provides novel nanomanufacturing tools in the areas of roll-to-roll manufacturing, and high speed, large area nanoimprinting. Our vision is to continue to enable and foster breakthrough nano-innovation in the areas of electronics and energy, which have significant presence in the South West. TNF will partner with the new Dell Medical Hospital at UT in the area of healthcare electronics and nanomedicine. Specifically, TNF will focus on science-to-scalability, where one integrates nanodevice prototyping with nanodevice manufacturing for industry. TNF will foster an innovation ecosystem by connecting our industrial users to the Longhorn Startup undergraduate entrepreneurship course at UT-Austin, the Austin Technology Incubator, and NSF I-Corps program. TNF will establish educational activities in nanotechnology directed at engaging underrepresented minorities, particularly Hispanics, who are a sizable minority in Texas, and women. Under the REU initiative, the facility will partner with Austin Community College to provide year-round research and training experience in nanotechnology for two-year college students.  Furthermore, TNF will explore the social and ethical implications of nanotechnology, and start a new effort on Education/Outreach focused on Computation and NSF Quantum Leap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
