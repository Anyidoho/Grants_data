<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2008 financial crisis, the preceding credit boom, and the subsequent credit contraction&lt;br/&gt;have highlighted the importance of access to credit for individual households for the health of the financial system and the economy. To guide policy proposals aimed at expanding access to credit for credit-worthy households, there is a need to know the forces behind the initiation and evolution of credit. This research project analyzes novel data and proposes a new theory to understand the behavior of emerging borrowers (borrowers who have only recently obtained their first line of credit or credit card) and their creditors. The empirical analysis documents new facts about how emerging borrowers expand their access to credit and how this process differs from the process for established borrowers. The project further develops a theoretical model of the interaction between borrowers and lenders. The theory provides guidance on policies aimed at expanding access to credit, such as allowing credit-reporting agencies to use non-traditional sources of information to assess the risk profiles of emerging borrowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses a novel dataset obtained from a credit reporting agency, which allows for examination of the behavior of individual lines of credit (credit cards) for borrowers over time. The project documents the effects of opening a new credit line on a borrower’s relations with existing and future lenders. Opening a new credit card by a borrower seems to be interpreted by lenders as a positive news and is associated with an expansion of existing credit lines. This force is much more pronounced for emerging borrowers than for established ones. The theoretical part of the project offers a dynamic model with multiple competing lenders who have heterogeneous private information about a consumer’s creditworthiness. The model incorporates selection and signaling mechanisms present when credit records aggregate information across lenders. One implication of this model is that while additional credit dilutes the value of existing loans by raising default risk, borrowers that receive larger additional loans pose lower default risk to their incumbent lenders than those who receive smaller additional loans. This theoretical prediction is tested and supported by the data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
