<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop technology to provide an in-depth downtime reduction analysis of computer-numerical controlled machines (CNCs), Additive Manufacturing (AM)/3D printing machines, computer-controlled appliances and complex engineered systems. The results of this project will affect a very large number of US CNC manufacturing facilities (over 19,000 CNC shops) as well as thousands of computer-controlled appliance repair companies, saving millions of dollars annually for the industry. The commercial potential of the project is is to minimize system downtime using service quality improvements. These groups of methods are analyzed and quantified using mathematical equations, algorithms, as well as visualization methods and tools. The results also will have an impact on manufacturing facilities and other complex engineered systems, such as robots, and cobots (collaborative robots), that have several complex computer-controlled, networked devices/instruments that need professional quality service to avoid downtime and failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project based on the development of technology for quantitative, predictive methods and tools that utilize quality-related key performance indicators (KPIs), that can be measured, calibrated, and enforced during service operations in computer-numerical controlled machines (CNCs), additive manufacturing (AM)/3D printing machines, and complex engineered systems.  Currently, there is no method or tool available for predicting the effectiveness or the level of success or risk of the services provided. The methods utilized are not systems engineering-focused, but rather financial accounting, and may or may not include reports of historical data to indicate the status of engineering-focused services provided. The technology under development is based on quantifiable service quality-focused key process/performance indicators (KPIs), using mathematical models, algorithms, and multimedia software visualization methods. This enables users to quantify levels of product/process quality service. In addition, the platform may be used to quantify and predict the product quality service as an index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
