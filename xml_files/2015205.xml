<AbstractNarration>The National Quantum Initiative Act was signed in December 2018 to ensure the United States remains competitive in technology and quantum information science. Quantum information science is fundamental to technology (e.g., cell phones), national defense, navigation (e.g., GPS), energy systems, banking security, and more. It is critical for the future workforce to understand basic principles of quantum mechanics and exposure to that knowledge should begin in grades K-12. Currently, most U.S. educators lack content background and confidence in teaching quantum information science. Furthermore, not all K-12 students take physics and even fewer will major in physics in college. Educators who recognize the relevance of quantum mechanics may not have adequate resources, curriculum, or content background to effectively introduce or teach quantum information science to students. This award supports the phased development of quantum information science curricula through summer workshops, communities of practice, and a conference of stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports three activities: (1) Development and implementation of summer workshops for teachers that focus on a cross-disciplinary approach to introducing quantum information science to high school teachers and their students. The workshops will utilize a matrix formalism for two-state spin systems and then use computer notebooks for hands-on computation of linear systems, thus integrating mathematics, physics, and computation.  (2) Building a community of practice.  This will include teachers engaged in the design and deployment of both science content and pedagogical content as they create lessons and curricular materials for their students. Evaluations of the first two activities will be conducted to explore the content knowledge growth of teachers and the barriers they encounter.  (3) Convening a conference of stakeholders. This conference will be a venue to articulate current efforts, describe lessons learned, explore the current and future workforce needs of industry partners, and chart an organized and research-driven pathway for improvement in K-12 quantum information science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by NSF's Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12) program, in the Directorate for Education &amp; Human Resources. DRK-12 seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. This project is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research, the Division of Physics and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
