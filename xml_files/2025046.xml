<AbstractNarration>Nearly half of undergraduate students who pursue STEM disciplines ultimately change fields. Many who leave STEM majors do so after taking introductory courses that serve as ?gatekeepers? to degree progression. Low grades and interest in introductory courses are important barriers to retention. A preliminary study shows that undergraduates who complete Introductory Biology I later in their college career earn lower grades and are more likely to fail than students who complete the course within their first year. The goal of this project is to identify motivational and academic factors that drive performance among first-year and upper-level students in introductory biology. The project will involve analysis of structured interviews and the development and implementation of a comprehensive survey to assess students? attitudes and beliefs about introductory biology. Ultimately, this work will inform approaches that foster success of all students in introductory coursework. Moreover, the project might identify interventions that could reduce achievement gaps among student groups, including those historically marginalized in STEM fields. The proposed project incorporates a tailored professional development plan that will advance the PI?s expertise in conducting biology education research. Through a certification program in educational research methods, mentorship from a leader in educational psychology, and participation in professional learning workgroups, the PI will gain skills necessary to fulfill research objectives. This opportunity will allow the PI to build a focal area in biology education, fill a national need for biology education researchers, and contribute to the training of the next generation of education researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Performance in introductory college coursework is directly correlated with retention and degree completion. Few studies have investigated how timing of course completion may affect students? motivation and academic outcomes. Preliminary data indicate that, despite having more experience at the college level, students who first attempt Introductory Biology I after their first year of college have significantly worse outcomes than first-year students. The proposed project aims to identify underlying motivational and academic elements that contribute to the performance of first-year and upper-level students in introductory biology. The research will involve students enrolled in Introductory Biology I at the University of Kentucky (annual enrollment = 1,300). The study will be sufficiently powered to explore specific subsets of students such as under-represented minorities and first-generation students. A mixed methods design will involve analysis of structured interviews and the development and implementation of a comprehensive survey to assess students? attitudes and beliefs about introductory biology. The project will harness the statistical power of large-scale survey data to identify latent variables that drive performance. Identifying differences in motivation and achievement between first-year and upper-level students would represent a fundamental contribution to the field and inform curricular and pedagogical interventions. The research aim will be fulfilled using skills gained through a professional development plan consisting of a certification program in educational research methods, mentorship from a leader in educational psychology, and participation in working groups. Through these opportunities, the PI will gain skills in survey design, qualitative methods, and advanced statistical analysis. The PI will develop a deep understanding of educational and social science research methods, perform rigorous fundamental research, and contribute new knowledge to the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is supported through the EHR Core Research: Building Capacity in STEM Education Research (ECR: BCSER) competition that is designed to build individuals? capacity to carry out high quality fundamental STEM education research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
