<AbstractNarration>Advances in semiconductor technology have enabled sophisticated computing systems to be integrated in small form-factor devices that are widely used in not only in computers, but in consumer electronics such as cellphones and have enabled a host of applications, such as  the internet-of-things, wearable electronics, portable medical devices, etc.  The integration of multiple computing and storage units in a single semiconductor device necessitates the scaling of networking science, typically developed for constraints between computers (such as the internet), down to a single-chip level, in order to enable efficient communication between on-chip elements.  This enables data-center-like operation on an individual chip populated with hundreds of processing elements, with computation capabilities that are equivalent to a network of computers, but with much improved portability, cost-effectiveness and energy-efficiency.  Such advancements are important to maintain US leadership of the computing, networking and semiconductor industries, as well as improving the connectivity of national human resources and the physical infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates computing system, VLSI, antenna design and networking principles for the integration of a novel Through-Silicon-Via-Antenna (TVSA)-based wireless network system into semiconductor devices packaged in the form factor of heterogeneous multi-die integration. The proposed wireless network for multi-die systems aims to create a scalable, reliable, and efficient network interconnect for current and emerging industry-standard multi-die processors. Through-Silicon-Via-Antennas are highly suited for on-chip wireless communication at minuscule footprints. This project focuses on the following tasks: (a) design and characterization of on-package TSVA; (b) wireless propagation modelling and channel characterization for multi-die systems using a Software Defined Radio (SDR) prototyping testbed; and (c) interconnect network system design by considering routing, latency, and throughput via cycle-accurate system-level simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
