<AbstractNarration>The project will partially cover travel expenses of graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and junior faculty members from institutions in the United States to participate in the conference entitled, "American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics (DFD) 73rd Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL, November 22-24, 2020. This is the largest international annual meeting of fluid dynamics researchers in the world, with over 2,500 anticipated attendees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chief intellectual merit of this conference lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of cutting-edge research, and exposure to a richly diverse array of topics in virtually every sub-discipline of fluid dynamics. The conference will be attended by both prominent and young scientists in fluid dynamics from around the world, who will be discussing present and future directions of research and research challenges. The conference will foster cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers in cutting edge areas of fluid dynamics and will address challenges involved in advancing the field. The broader impact will be to increase participation of students and young scientists who would not otherwise be able to afford to travel to the meeting and pay associated costs. The travel grant program has traditionally prioritized meeting attendance by students, young scientists, and, in general, scientists from under-represented groups. Since the awards are meant to supplement participant travel funds, not to cover these entirely, the committee takes into account the travel budget entered on the application. Special effort is made to achieve diverse participation from underrepresented groups in engineering, including women and members of minority groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
