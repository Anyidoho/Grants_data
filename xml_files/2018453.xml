<AbstractNarration>The Small Institution Multiple Organization Regional OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (SI-MORe-OFFN) project makes advanced cyberinfrastructure tools and services available to five smaller campuses in Oklahoma, covering scientific disciplines from chemistry and agriculture to health and nursing by connecting these campuses to the OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (OFFN). The five targeted campuses are Redlands Community College, University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma, Oklahoma State University Institute of Technology, Oklahoma State University in Oklahoma City and Oklahoma Christian University. The project provides new and diverse research collaboration opportunities for faculty across Oklahoma and enables the smaller, target institutions to expand their research and education activities. The project also has a significant educational impact for undergraduate and community college students at these metropolitan and rural campuses by providing them with additional STEM and cyber-infrastructure educational opportunities as well as exposure to leading researchers and cyber-infrastructure practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SI-MORe-OFFN project extends the OneOklahoma Friction Free Network to five smaller institutions by implementing Science DMZs, Data Transfer Nodes and network performance monitoring capabilities at identified locations and integrating these with other similar capabilities across Oklahoma. In addition, the project enhances the skills and abilities of technical personnel at each campus and facilitates cross-campus collaborations, including shared uses of computing tools, scientific equipment, and educational materials by engaging faculty and students in the larger OneOklahoma CyberInfrastructure Initiative (OneOCII). OFFN is managed by OneNet, Oklahoma?s research and education network, and scientific leadership is provided by the University of Oklahoma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
