<AbstractNarration>This travel award will support 20 U.S.-based early-career researchers to attend the 2020 International Conference on Resource Sustainability (icRS 2020) to be held in Dublin, Ireland from June 30th to July 2nd, 2020. The icRS 2020 conference serves as a platform for researchers and practitioners around the world to advance the critical role of resources in the circular economy from the diverse perspectives of underdeveloped, developing and developed economies. The conference will discuss how to achieve urban sustainability through wise resources management policy and practices. Attending the conference will allow the U.S.-based early-career researchers to showcase their research and to develop networks with their peers around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the conference, it is expected that a diverse group of 400-500 participants will share their work through both paper and poster presentations, as well as formal and informal discussions. Researchers from groups underrepresented in STEM fields will be given priority in participant selection. High-quality papers from the conference will be recommended to special issues in journals that support the conference. An Editor Panel will be organized at the conference to allow direct interactions between conference attendees and editors of relevant journals on academic publishing. Early-career researchers will benefit from formal interactions with editors at the Editor Panel as well as informal interactions during the conference.  This networking will help their academic careers through a better understanding of editorial criteria in evaluating manuscript submissions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
