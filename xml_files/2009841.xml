<AbstractNarration>This project will create new methods of using optical fibers for examining tissue for early signs of cancer. Although optical detection of early cancer has been shown, there has yet to be a technology that can be readily used by clinicians. This new method will be simpler and less costly to build than previous approaches and thus will provide a societal benefit by enabling greater use of optical methods for detecting early cancer in the clinic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop a novel approach for detecting early cancer based on angle resolved light scattering. The unique aspect of this new approach is that rather than measuring scattering at different angles at the tissue surface, instead a single, multimode fiber will be used to collect all of the angular scattering and then computational methods will be used to reconstruct the angular distribution.  The approach will permit simplified measurements and analysis by using knowledgeof the distribution of scattering from cell nuclei, specifically that it forms ringed patterns.  A key proposed advance of this work will be to enable use of the fiber even when it is moved, for example during an endoscopy procedure, by leveraging the simplified measurements and introducing a real time calibration method.  The approach will be demonstrated by measuring enlarged nuclei in cultured cancer cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
