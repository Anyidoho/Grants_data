<AbstractNarration>Diversity can yield measurable benefits for teams and organizations. Prior research shows that functional diversity––the degree to which  team  members  differ  in terms of their experience or background––can positively influence team functioning through the increase of information, skills, ability, and knowledge that diversity may bring. Though emerging societal norms advocate diversity and inclusion, hardwired tendencies create an attraction to people who are similar and familiar. This poses a challenge to organizations seeking to leverage the benefits of diversity in teams. Can technologies help organizations and their co-workers assemble more diverse teams? This Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant (DDRIG) seeks to understand  how  augmented  intelligence technologies can facilitate people to assemble in functional diverse teams. The findings and applications of this research will contribute to stakeholder communities that are invested in increasing diversity in teams. The research will also deliver a team recommender system to the public for enabling participants to assemble their own teams using augmented intelligence, and enabling participants to discuss and learn about diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves a program of laboratory experiments controlling the presence and absence of human agency and augmented intelligence when individuals are assembling  teams. The project will assess the formation processes of teams assembled (a) randomly, (b) by participants, and (c) by participants using augmented intelligence. The research will examine the three team formation conditions and analyze participants’ search queries, decisions to invite or accept invitations from potential teammates, their resulting teams’ composition, and performance. The project will also study their interaction processes and outcomes after the team is formed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
