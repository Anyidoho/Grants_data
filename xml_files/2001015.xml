<AbstractNarration>A noncommutative algebra is a fundamental concept that represents solutions  to a system of equations of several non-commuting variables. Noncommutative  algebras are frequently used to encode models for networks, communication,  quantum computing, and chemical molecules, as well as many other objects in sciences and engineering. It is generally impossible to assess a given  algebra by dealing with its elements, while invariants of an algebra capture  many key features of the algebra. Then understanding invariants becomes extremely beneficial for understanding different aspects of these algebras.  This project focuses on new invariants of noncommutative algebras that arise  from several subjects such as noncommutative projective geometry, category  theory, combinatorics, and the study of infinite dimensional Hopf algebras  or quantum groups. The principal investigator will involve graduate students and postdoctoral  fellows in this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns several central topics in the field of noncommutative  algebra with connections to noncommutative geometry, combinatorics, the  representation theory of quivers and category theory. The principal investigator plans to study  several invariants of noncommutative algebras and their associated categories,  to develop foundations for new research directions, and to classify algebraic  objects that describe noncommutative spaces. Specifically the project investigates noncommutative discriminants, Frobenius-Perron dimension,  primitive cohomology, and other effective invariants and crucial structures  in noncommutative algebras, quiver representations and tensor triangulated  categories. The principal investigator continues to search for methods for the automorphism  problem, the isomorphism problem, and different versions of the cancellation  problem in noncommutative algebra. Finally one of PI's ultimate goals is to  construct new Hopf algebra domains of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension two in  positive characteristic and new tensor triangulated structures on the quiver  representations of either finite or tame representation type.  The principal investigator will train students in fields closely related to his research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
