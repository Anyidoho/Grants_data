<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to investigate applications of a new high-performance mechanical gearbox. Electric motors account for approximately 23 percent of electricity consumed in the United States and roughly 63 percent of manufacturing sector electricity.  An improvement in geared motor technology can help realize energy savings.  A magnetic gear creates speed change without any physical contact, requires no gear lubrication, has inherent overload protection, has low acoustic emissions and low starting torque. Due to its contact-free torque production, a magnetic gear has the potential for a long lifetime while operating at high efficiency.  This project will advance the development of a magnetic gearbox, with many potential applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores the trade space of magnetic gearboxes with regard to efficiency, thermal stability, and torque density and the potential trade-offs with respect to cost.  Multiphysics-based numerical and analytic modeling co-design techniques will be utilized to explore the thermal and mechanical sizing trade-offs impacting the efficiency of the magnetic gears while mitigating magnet demagnetization. The proposed designs will utilize a unique laminated magnet array combined with the laminated slotted modulator.  The project will explore the design trade-offs with respect to stack length and mechanical deflection in the context of the magnetic and thermal design.  The project will demonstrate the efficiency and performance capabilities of a magnetic gearbox compared with an equivalently sized mechanically geared motor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
