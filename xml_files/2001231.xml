<AbstractNarration>Understanding how the brain produces behavior and mental processes such as cognitive functions is one of the major goals in neuroscience. The brain consists of millions of neurons that are interconnected and form distinct circuits that transmit signals in coordinated manners. To analyze how neural circuit activity lead to behavior, neuroscientists rely on technologies to manipulate and track signal transmission of neurons in live animals. This project aims to develop strategies to form a novel interfacing device technology capable of chronically stable, optical, multi-regional, and bi-directional neural communication in behaving animals. Successful development of the flexible neural interfacing device would enable newfound understanding of the mechanism of human brain functions, as well as improved treatment protocols for neuropsychological diseases such as the Parkinson?s disease. Another aim of this project is to create a new course on bioelectronics that include intensive lab modules on layer-transfer processes for thin-film electronic devices, aimed at providing K-12 to graduate students opportunities to apply textbook theories to research laboratory settings or industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The state-of-the-art neurotechnologies rely on optical fibers or miniaturized microscopes to deliver light to and from the animal?s brain, which is engineered to produce proteins that make neurons interact with light at specific wavelengths. The two approaches, however, suffer problems such as poor resolution and inability to interact with neurons in deep brain regions, respectively, which limit their potential for brain-wide interfacing. This project aims to address these issues by developing a novel semiconductor-based optical brain-machine interface via the heterointegration of thin-film III-V optoelectronic devices in flexible geometries. Integration of freestanding, single-crystalline layers of micro-LEDs and photodetectors can yield a novel device platform capable of simultaneous optogenetic neuromodulation and functional recording in behaving mouse brains. The development of such technology requires wide range of skillset including the design, epitaxial growth, layer-transfer, and micro-fabrication of the neural probe, as well as in vivo demonstration including surgical implantation, input/output interconnection, optical stimulation and recording, and data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
