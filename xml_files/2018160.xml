<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo is acquiring a 500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with an automatic sample changer to support Professor Steven Diver and colleagues: Timothy Cook, Bing Gong, Janet Morrow and Javid Rzavev. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as permitting study of biologically-relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. NMR is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is important to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution and nearby universities in Western New York such as Canisius College, D?Youville College, Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute and Medaille College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. This instrument acquisition impacts studies of chalcogen-containing cationic dyes used in photocatalysis. The instrumentation is used in investigations of small molecules activation using coordination-driven self-assembly and nanoporous organic structures based on folding and assembly. In addition, the spectrometer provides information to aid the design, preparation, and studies of size-selective macrocycle catalysts of importance in manufacturing. The instrument is also used to explore the use of iron(III) coordination complexes and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents and guides the design of polymer assembly with defined molecular architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
