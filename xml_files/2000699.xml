<AbstractNarration>As large manufacturers continue to move into the Reno, Nevada area, there is a growing need for skilled technicians. Filling this demand for advanced manufacturing technicians is critical to support the success of the region's advanced manufacturing industry, as well as to support the region?s economic development goal. This project intends to address this need by increasing access of high school students to the college?s dual enrollment program in advanced manufacturing.  It will do so by developing and using augmented reality and simulated lab experiences at the high schools. In addition, a new employability skills curriculum will be developed and integrated into advanced manufacturing courses, to prepare students for success in the workplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are to: 1) provide greater access to academic pathways leading to an Associate Degree in Advanced Manufacturing; 2) help students learn the critical technical skills needed by manufacturers; and 3) help students learn employability skills that are needed to be hired, stay employed, and advance in a technical career. Access to an existing dual enrollment curriculum in advanced manufacturing will be expanded to more high schools in the region. Multimedia training exercises will be developed including simulations, augmented reality, and electronic training materials for off-site locations using advanced augmented reality headsets and software. The employability skills curriculum will include instruction in collaboration and teamwork, communication, critical and creative thinking, leadership, self-management, and social responsibility.   This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
