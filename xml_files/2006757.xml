<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this CAREER project is to develop novel membrane materials for fuel cell applications and integrate this research into polymer education through appropriate courses and laboratory experiences. The research and education plan for this project will be achieved by: 1) Designing and preparing new fuel cell membranes for transport of electric charges; 2) Evaluating the properties and performance of the novel materials; 3) Modifying the materials to improve their properties; and 4) Merging polymer chemistry with general chemistry concepts by designing an "Introduction to Polymer Chemistry: General Chemistry Concepts" lecture and lab course for freshman students. The proposed research significantly enhances Fisk University's current and future research capabilities in polymer science through the introduction of this course that is deeply imbedded in the research objectives of this proposal, but simple enough to arouse student's interest and learning.  Furthermore, the proposed two-semester introductory polymer course/inquiry-based lab experience, which is a student-selected alternative to traditional General Chemistry, will facilitate the enhancement of learning and research skills for undergraduate students. Introduction of authentic research beginning in the freshman year should also increase the retention of undergraduates (including underrepresented minorities) in STEM (science/technology/engineering/mathematics) and increase the pipeline of underrepresented talent for STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to synthesize hybrid copolymers of disulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone)s (PAESs) by incorporating a post-modifiable unit, 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine (TT), into the polymer backbone.  The significance of this approach is that the properties of the proton exchange membrane for fuel cells could be engineered for precisely tailored performance by tuning the microstructure of the copolymer backbone using varying and distinct structural/functional features.  The disulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone- 2,4,6-Trichloro-1,3,5-triazine) (PAES-TT) hybrid copolymers will be prepared to form linear, high molecular-weight materials after optimizing the required synthetic steps.  Subsequently, PAES-TT membranes will be prepared and characterized to evaluate their structure-property relationships and performance in proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell applications.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of this proposal is centered on developing an "Introduction to Polymer Chemistry: General Chemistry Concepts" lecture and lab course for freshman students as a means to incorporate student research experiences into the regular academic-year curriculum.  Exposure of students to research, mentoring of students, broadening participation of underrepresented groups in science, and increasing the pipeline of underrepresented talent for STEM careers are other major components of the broader impacts of this project.</AbstractNarration>
