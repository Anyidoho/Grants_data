<AbstractNarration>This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's "Windows on the Universe" Big Idea. This project aims at maximizing the scientific output of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, via formulating strategies for detector improvements and the development and implementation of new data analysis algorithms. This project will contribute to the advancement of precision measurement technology, deepen understandings of general relativity, and push the frontier of experimental physics at the interface between gravitational and quantum physics.  It also supports the observation and interpretation of multi-messenger astrophysical sources.  This project will serve as a training ground for early career physicists and astrophysicists, teaching them a wide variety of research techniques. By interacting with the broader quantum metrology community, this project will benefit other precision measurement experiments outside the gravitational-wave community.  Participants of this project will also vigorously pursue a wide range of activities that reach out to the the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary scientific objective of this program is to drive the continued improvement of LIGO sensitivity, to enable the most efficient analysis of LIGO data, and to extract fundamental physics from upcoming LIGO detections.  More specifically: (A) The proposed research program will formulate and evaluate innovative approaches to improving LIGO's sensitivity, by inventing new quantum metrology techniques for use in future detectors, and by studying strategies toward lowering thermal noise, beam-scattering noise, and toward nonlinear regression using auxiliary channels. The program will also explore new approaches toward GW detection, e.g., atom interferometry and displacement-noise-free interferometry. By collaborating with experimentalists, participants will attempt to make theoretical progress that will eventually make impacts in real experiments. (B) Numerical relativity simulations of binary black holes and binaries containing neutron stars will be used for LIGO data analysis: (i) Simulations following up on LIGO detections will be used to verify the accuracy of phenomenological waveform models, to explore parameter biases of these models, and to perform alternative parameter estimation strategies as needed; and (ii) Surrogate waveform models, which interpolate between numerical relativity waveforms to produce a waveform at requested parameters to high accuracy, will be implemented into LALSuite and be used in parameter estimation studies on future events. (C) Aspects of general relativity will be tested and demonstrated using LIGO data, including: testing the existence of non-GR structures near the horizon, and using the coherent stacking of waveforms from multiple sources to reconstruct the emission pattern of a single source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
