<AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the efficacy of partnerships between TCUP institutions and their mainstream university or private sector partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) will organize and convene a group of TCU STEM and Information Technology Staff to develop and incorporate cyberinfrastructure (CI) planning into institutional planning processes.  The project will recruit, train, and support TCU faculty, IT professionals, and administrators in CI planning efforts to support growth in STEM fields. The team will work with TCUs to participate in planning workshop activities, which includes evaluating STEM plans and CI needs, linking TCU teams with subject matter experts, and facilitating the development of CI strategic plans from participating TCUs. The project will help TCUs identify potential sources of funding and assist in the development of competitive proposals.  The aim is to foster the collaboration and planning needed to support and strengthen TCU STEM research and education programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
