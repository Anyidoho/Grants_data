<AbstractNarration>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Measurement and Evaluation (SIGMETRICS) 2020 conference will be held at the International Science and Engineering Complex of Northeastern University in Boston, MA from June 8?12, 2020. ACM SIGMETRICS 2020 aims to provide a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further our knowledge and understanding of the measurement, modeling, analysis, and design of computing and networked systems. The conference interprets computer systems broadly, including traditional computing systems as well as social networks, data networks, and other types of systems. Contributions containing highly original ideas, new approaches, and/or ground-breaking results are particularly encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support for about 25 US based students to attend the SIGMETRICS 2020 conference. The support will make possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference. Particular attention will be paid to directing support towards various underrepresented population. SIGMETRICS brings together professionals from a wide variety of academic and industrial backgrounds; student participants will thus get the opportunity to interact with mentors and peers of varying gender, ethnicity and background. Students will also benefit from the student-centric events, including a student workshop/panel and a student research competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
