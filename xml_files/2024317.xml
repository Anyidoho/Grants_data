<AbstractNarration>This proposal supports 20 students' travel to attend the 2020 The International Association of Cryptologic Research (IACR)'s annual International Cryptology Conference (Crypto) to be held at the University of California, Santa Barbara August 16-20, 2020. Since the first conference in 1981, Crypto has been held in Santa Barbara, California, and has become the flagship conference in cryptology, attracting researchers from all over the world. The scope of the work discussed and presented at the conference ranges from the theoretical foundation of cryptology to applications and the implementation of cryptographic schemes. This travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school education for our society's future computer security researchers. Students will have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer security researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support to encourage participation in the 2020 conference by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by research output, coursework and/or project experience. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
