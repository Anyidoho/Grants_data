<AbstractNarration>Quantum computing promises to revolutionize the entire paradigm of computing with significant societal impact. Along with advances is research and development, it also requires the next-generation of quantum-trained workforce who will be able to take advantage of the technological changes. This project is a planning grant to determine the requirements for development of an academic hosted and online accessible trapped ion-based quantum computer testbed. A testbed of this nature will give computer scientists access to a functioning quantum computer to test new ideas in the area quantum algorithms. This planning grant would have four goals: 1) determine the desire of the broader quantum computer scientist community in having access to open quantum computer; 2) define the requirements for the minimum number of qubits to have an effective resource for researcher; 3) determine the at what level in the computing stack would researcher like access to the computer; 4) determine the appropriate balance between a computing resource the broad quantum community and the academic nature of the device as a tool to educational and workforce development. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The approach in this planning grant is to enable the next generation of quantum computing platforms for computer engineering and computer science researchers to perform algorithm research. Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) has demonstrated leadership in developing ion trap quantum system hardware over the last fifteen years. The project will leverage the expertise in this joint effort between GTRI and Georgia Institute of Technology and enable a ten-qubit quantum computing testbed with open source software infrastructure and capability of remote access. It is expected to directly impact the following research vectors: (1) Microarchitecture research to explore topics related to but not limited to physical model driven error correction, resiliency, noisy intermediate state quantum computing models etc. (2) Algorithm research to understand the fundamental advantages and limitations of quantum algorithms from space-time complexity on a practical system with its full software stack. (3) Applications research which will span over engineering as well as science disciplines ? with a focus on CISE related research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
