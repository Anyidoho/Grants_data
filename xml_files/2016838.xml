<AbstractNarration>This project will support a two-day grantsmanship workshop designed to increase the success of predominately undergraduate institutions (PUIs) and Historically Black Colleges (HBCs) in obtaining grant funding to support science education and research, and to broaden access to science careers for undergraduate college students.  Rhodes College, which is located in Memphis, TN, will host the workshop for faculty, administrators, and undergraduate college students of Rhodes College, the University of Memphis, three HBCs (LeMoyne-Owen College, Lane College, and Rust College) and other colleges in the larger Memphis region.  Rhodes College’s geographical location in Memphis places it within the same city as LeMoyne-Owen College and within short driving distances of Lane College and Rust College.  During the workshop, faculty and administrators will participate in workshop sessions on successful grant-writing and identifying funding opportunities that align with their institutions’ science research and educational missions.  Students will learn strategies for identifying and applying for summer research internships across the country.  Students will also learn about the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship Program and how to become a competitive applicant for this prestigious award, which supports outstanding students who are pursuing a Master’s or doctoral degree in a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines. The Broader Impacts of this project include the participation of three HBCs, providing the potential to increase access to science careers for students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.  As a result of the workshop, faculty and students at these three HBCs will be better prepared to apply for grant funding to enhance science infrastructure and education at those institutions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faculty at Rhodes College and neighboring research institutions surrounding Memphis, TN have been active in pursuing external funding.  However, success in obtaining large research grant awards in recent years can be challenging for many faculty.  Thus, one goal of this workshop is to improve grantsmanship skills and provide faculty the tools to identify new funding opportunities, with the goal of increasing access to research grants for science faculty at Memphis area institutions.  Rhodes College and Memphis-area faculty not only train undergraduate students via summer research positions, but also recruit students from LeMoyne-Owen College, Lane College, and Rust College, three Historically Black Colleges (HBCs) in the greater Memphis region.  Strengthening these longstanding partnerships is expected to increase the number of summer research internships that are available to undergraduates from regional HBCs.  The Broader Impacts of this project are expected to increase participation of groups underrepresented in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
