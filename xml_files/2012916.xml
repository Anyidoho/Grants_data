<AbstractNarration>The universe contains astrophysical objects that accelerate particles to energies beyond the reach of any device yet built by humans, but what drives these accelerators remains a major question in astrophysics.  This study uses the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) to study very high energy particle accelerators in our Milky Way Galaxy.  The group will continue to operate and maintain the VERITAS pointing monitors and contribute to array operations, and lead in the creation of an archive of high-level science results from VERITAS.  The science results will deepen understanding of how energetic particles are accelerated in our Galaxy.  This group has developed a program to host an undergraduate summer intern from an under-represented minority (URM) every summer, as a way to increase the participation of URM students in astrophysics research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It had long been thought that cosmic rays are accelerated in young supernova remnants, but VERITAS observations unexpectedly showed a lack of the necessary emission at high energies.  Targets for deep observation include gamma-ray sources and other accelerator candidate objects, which need to be capable of producing cosmic rays with energies of 10^15 eV, the so-called Pevatrons.  The team will also observe a hard spectrum and extended shell-type supernova remnant recently discovered with the Fermi observatory, along with other supernova remnants, better to understand how they could accelerate energetic particles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
