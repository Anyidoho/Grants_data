<AbstractNarration>Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project at Alabama State University (ASU) will enhance the Forensics Research Infrastructure at the institution and is anticipated to lead to increased retention of students. The work will develop students' problem-solving skills and provide STEM research opportunities. An expected outcome is nurturing the success of underrepresented groups to promote their inclusion in STEM pipelines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students without prior research experience will initially be trained at ASU. They will learn a variety of laboratory skills such as DNA extraction from cadaver tissues, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), agarose gel electrophoresis, and other transferable research skills. Students will then be eligible to participate in a 5-day training session at a partner institution, such as Florida International University's International Forensic Research Institute in Miami. Research mentors with competencies in state-of-the-art techniques have been selected from partner institutions, these techniques include chemical, genetic, and physical forensic analyses using human specimens and evidence collected at crime scene.  This project will also enhance introductory forensic infrastructure by implementing a Freshman Retention Program (FRP), integrating new cyberlearning modules, and adding new forensic courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
