<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to advance the development of a self-cleaning coating technology for applications in household products, automotive, sensors and aerospace. Fluorinated materials have been widely used in self-cleaning applications due to their excellent wear characteristics, and super-hydrophobicity, but their environmental impact motivates new solutions.  Attempts to date have typically resulted in materials that are cloudy, non-durable and/or too expensive for commercial relevance. This project will advance a new coating that adheres well to substrates, offers high abrasion resistance similar to glass, and exceptional weather resistance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will allow the advancement of a durable, non-fluorinated, super omniphobic, optically clear coatings for industrial applications. The proposed work is focused on enhancing the performance of nonfluorinated omniphobic coatings in three specific ways. First, the adhesion of omniphobic coatings will be improved such that they will be able to withstand submersion in water for months without showing swelling/delamination. This will be achieved by using water stable urethane polymers and/or prior surface treatment of the substrate. Second, the abrasion resistance of the coating will be enhanced by using a combination of urethane precursors and fillers. Finally, the weatherability will be increased by using UV stabilizers along with UV stable urethane polymers such that the coatings will have improved performance in outdoor applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
