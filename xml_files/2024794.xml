<AbstractNarration>This National Robotics Initiative project will promote the progress of science and advance the national prosperity and welfare by creating novel dexterous robotic manipulators consisting of arrays of compliant delta robots. Many collaborative robot (co-robot) applications require safe, dexterous, and delicate manipulation around people. For example, in the physically assistive task of helping people take medication, a robot must be able to open a pill bottle, grasp a small pill, and gently feed that pill to a human. All of these tasks require sophisticated manipulation abilities, which are naturally performed by humans using their fingers and fingertips, but most current robot manipulators are lacking. The human hand is not the only form factor capable of achieving dexterous and delicate manipulation. This grant focuses on building dexterous manipulators consisting of arrays of small compliant robots that work in sync to achieve sophisticated manipulation skills. Accessible fabrication techniques like 3D printing lower barriers to access for robotic technologies, which makes these robots great candidates not only as assistive co-robots in healthcare and other applications but also as educational tools from K-12 to graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project covers the full pipeline of development for a novel co-robot manipulation system, contributing: (1) Hardware design and fabrication of individual delta robots, investigating novel combinations of geometry, materials, actuation, and sensorization using modular and easily replicable components; (2) Control models that can actively calibrate themselves and handle real-time variations caused by fabrication imperfections or wear and tear; (3) Manipulation strategies that coordinate a distributed array of delta robots into a single effective manipulator, capable of sophisticated manipulations such as in-hand object rotation; and (4) Design of human-robot interactions that address performance, safety, and human perception in close-proximity physically assistive tasks. This transformative research expands the design space of parallel manipulators, enabling them to be used as safe and compliant robotic fingers. The delta robot arrays are customizable for a specific task and scale well through their modular design and unified framework for coordination. Accessible manufacturing methods like 3D printing and laser machining, along with the robots' self-calibrating control models, lower barriers to entry for widespread use. Last but not least, these safe, dexterous, and compliant robotic fingers can have an impact on society by enabling the development of manipulators that assist humans with important physical activities such as taking medication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
