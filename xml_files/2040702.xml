<AbstractNarration>The NSF Convergence Accelerator supports use-inspired, team-based, multidisciplinary efforts that address challenges of national importance and will produce deliverables of value to society in the near future. The project aims to develop a quantum simulation platform based on programmable atom arrays. Utilizing recent advances in nanophotonics, the arrays will enable controlling individual atoms with greater precision and flexibility. By being cloud-accessible, the platform will be available to a broad user-base. The platform aims to be a testbed for developing and implementing quantum algorithms with real-world relevance in materials science, quantum chemistry, and optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to develop a novel integrated atomic quantum simulator that will combine features of analog quantum simulation and digital quantum computing in the same device. The project will perform proof-of-concept studies in these focus areas: (1) atomic platform that is based on neutral strontium atoms in ground and Ryderg states; (2) lasers and photonics that feature holographic atom traps and compact, chip-based laser systems; (3) timing and control system that includes a quantum sequencer with nanosecond-resolution; (4) user interface that will be built by professional software engineers to allow secure and easy cloud-access; and (5) quantum algorithms and applications to inform the design of the hardware to realize a system that can provide quantum advantage for applications in materials research, chemistry, logistics and finance. The project team includes physicists, engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, and educators from academia, national labs and industry. Deliverables include (1) demonstration of a compact source of ultracold strontium atoms; (2) demonstration of laser cooling of strontium via a chip-based integrated laser; (3) concept for a professionally designed timing and quantum sequencer system; (4) definition and implementation of a proof-of-concept professional user interface; and (5) identification of relevant quantum algorithms that can run on the hardware to be developed. The project aims to advance quantum simulation and quantum computation and will provide opportunities for students and other researchers to engage in quantum information research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
