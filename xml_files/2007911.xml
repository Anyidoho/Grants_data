<AbstractNarration>Recent years have witnessed tremendous growth in the need of distributed information processing, where the data are collected, stored, and processed in and through a large network of distributed agents. Examples include training better machine intelligence using mobile devices to improve user experiences, monitoring environments using a network of sensors to reduce and mitigate wildfire, improving the coordination of unmanned aerial vehicles in surveillance. This project embarks on a new framework to address emerging challenges in processing the ever-growing large-scale datasets in a resource-efficient manner that have been unaddressed until now. The investigators will actively recruit and train students with diverse backgrounds including underrepresented minorities and women in STEM through long-term mentoring and outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will substantially advance the algorithmic practice of statistical learning and inference from high-dimensional distributed data, by developing resource-efficient distributed statistical inference algorithms in network environments that provably achieve the optimal trade-offs in statistical error, computation and communication costs, thereby enabling scalable processing of decentralized and heterogenous data. Calling for a tight integration of high-dimensional statistical inference and large-scale decentralized optimization, this project consists of three major thrusts: (i) develop resource-efficient decentralized statistical estimation algorithms with provable convergence guarantees; (ii) develop systematic treatments to ensure algorithmic convergence even in the presence of highly unbalanced and heterogeneous data, as well as promote diversity for heterogeneous agents using graph regularization; (iii) promote optimal and adaptive early stopping criteria for decentralized nonparametric estimation. The tools and techniques developed herein will further foster the interplay between a broad range of fields including high-dimensional statistics, large-scale optimization, statistical signal processing, and machine learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
