<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;The Cornell Nanoscale Science and Technology Facility (CNF) as part of the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI) will offer an external user program open to all US researchers, delivering prompt, affordable, hands-on 24/7 shared access. CNF is both regional and national in scope, drawing users from throughout the US, with the goal of enabling transformative research and accelerating commercialization across a range of research fields. The new research and technology development that the CNF makes possible will transform numerous fields of engineering and science, addressing many of NSF’s 10 Big Ideas including Convergence Research, Quantum Leap, the Data Revolution, the Future of Work, the Rules of Life and NSF Includes. CNF will cultivate communities of researchers in less-traditional areas through partnership with other disciplinary centers, through activities such as subject-area workshops and through appointment of an Associate Director focused on life science and convergence research. The CNF will also provide education and outreach programs targeting a wide range of researchers, undergraduates, and K-12 students, with the broader goals of providing a hands-on research education to a new generation of diverse engineering and science students, fostering interdisciplinary interactions among diverse research communities, extending the benefits of nanofabrication to less-traditional areas of research, and interesting more young students in technology and science. The CNF will continue to help companies to fabricate prototypes and develop and refine new processes, working with local and state technology incubators to assist the transition to commercialization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;The unique capabilities that the CNF will make available to the nation's researchers include: i) world-leading electron-beam lithography and production quality optical lithography tools for nanofabrication, ii) flexibility in contamination-free materials processing through its strong and diverse toolset enhanced by those for state-of-the-art atomic layer deposition and etch, iii) experienced and knowledgeable staff, solely dedicated to user support who will train even novice users in sophisticated, safe nanofabrication methods and share knowledge in topics ranging from quantum qubit production to application of artificial intelligence to nanofabrication, and iv) a proven record of success in serving a large user base, experienced in convergent research, while providing an unequaled level of service to external users. This combination of capabilities enables realization of research visions and commercialization of discoveries. Organized educational and outreach programs are designed to benefit several target audiences. CNF will teach new nanotechnology researchers to expertly operate at the research frontier through hands-on training on state-of-the-art tools, in-depth minicourses, and subject-area workshops. Experienced nanotechnology researchers will benefit from advanced technical workshops in partnership with leading tool vendors. Diverse undergraduate students will participate in unique summer research experiences, including students from a new partnership with Morgan State University, an HBCU. Young K-12 students and their families will be encouraged to become engaged in technology and science through the highly-popular Nanooze, NNCI’s CNF-produced online science news magazine and a national partnership with 4-H.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
