<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research project, involving Michigan State University, the University of North Texas and the University of Michigan, will examine whether epistemic exclusion, a form a scholarly devaluation, may create a barrier to the full inclusion and participation of women and faculty of color in STEM. Epistemic exclusion is the devaluation of certain types of scholarship that occurs when invisible biases in systems of evaluation are coupled with prejudice toward, and negative stereotypes about, historically underrepresented groups.  Because faculty members' career outcomes (e.g., promotion, tenure, and turnover intentions) are determined by how well they meet evaluative standards, bias in systems of evaluation that disproportionately harm women and faculty of color may impede their retention and advancement in academia. The project team will create and validate a scale assessing faculty epistemic exclusion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of the project have the potential to benefit society by providing a tool that researchers can use to investigate epistemic exclusion in STEM faculty.  Advancing this line of research may result in potential interventions and policy changes at institutions of higher education that improve the retention and promotion of women and underrepresented minority STEM faculty at our nationâ€™s colleges and universities.  There is a plan for dissemination to scholarly audiences through peer-reviewed presentation and publications in professional journals that will help inform the research and academic communities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. The ECR program supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning and participation.  The project was co-funded by the NSF ADVANCE program which supports the implementation of organizational change strategies to address systemic inequities that impact women in STEM faculty careers.  The project was also funded by the Alliances for Graduate Education and Professoriate (AGEP) program, which funds projects designed to advance knowledge about increasing the number of African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native American Indians, Native Hawaiians and Native Pacific Islanders in STEM faculty careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
