<AbstractNarration>This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's "Windows on the Universe" Big Idea. The first detections of gravitational waves from coalescing black holes and binary neutron systems have established multi-messenger astrophysics as a powerful tool for the exploration of the cosmos. Multi-messenger astrophysics allows scientists to explore in depth the origins and structure of black holes and compact stars, test Einstein?s theory of general relativity, probe the fundamental nature of gravity and measure the evolution of the Universe.  This project will contribute to this endeavor by sustaining the scientific operations of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) and by developing new enhanced methods for gravitational-wave data analysis. These activities will enable LIGO to operate effectively and perform core science during observing runs. Along with the scientific component of the project, this award will sustain public outreach initiatives in the local community and participation in state-wide educational programs aimed at promoting science among diverse segments of the Missouri population, in particular women and other under-represented groups in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to LIGO scientific operations by running astrophysical multi-messenger searches for gravitational-wave burst sources, characterizing instrumental data, calibrating the LIGO detectors, assisting operations on site, and improving existing data analysis algorithms. Contributions to Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities will consist in developing new machine learning-based methods for de-noising LIGO data, extending the reach of astrophysical searches for un-modeled, burst-like gravitational-wave signals, and characterizing gravitational-wave observations from multi-messenger astrophysical sources. These activities will improve LIGO search pipelines and provide new, effective methods to extract physical information from detector data in the next LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
