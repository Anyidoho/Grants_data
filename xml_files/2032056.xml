<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is development of a disinfectant spray to curb the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via contact with contaminated surfaces. COVID-19 transmission occurs primarily via respiratory droplets produced by an infected person and by contact with a surface where a droplet containing the virus exists. Mitigating infection by contact with surfaces is a measure that will slow the spread of novel viruses ahead of development of a vaccine or other protective measures. In conjunction with other measures, a novel disinfectant will support public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Current disinfectants require times ranging from 30 seconds to 10 minutes for disinfection to begin after application and do not continue to disinfect. The proposed technology creates a temporary, continually disinfecting film that remains on the application surface. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project will demonstrate both the rapid performance of a novel spray and its ability to form a temporary and continually disinfecting film post=application. This technology employs a select medium containing fast-response doped nanoceria where the oxidizing response/mechanism is engineered to perform several disinfectant reactions in parallel. A safe, rapid, multi-disinfectant approach using engineered nanoceria has not previously been demonstrated for use. The project will also demonstrate the post-application disinfection properties. The goals of this project will be achieved with the following: 1) development of an anti-viral, multi-mechanism disinfectant formulation, 2) demonstration of efficacy and safety, 3) study of product stability, and 4) demonstration of temporary film formation, stability, and activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
