<AbstractNarration>Trusted hardware is the foundation of cybersecurity. The International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST) is a leading forum for hardware security researchers. This travel grant enables student researchers to attend the symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposed activity includes professional development for undergraduate and graduate students as well as continued growth of the symposium. HOST 2020 will be held in San Jose, CA on May 4-7, 2020. This project provides opportunities for 60 students to receive travel support to attend HOST 2020. Their attendance enables them to learn about the latest tools, design methods, architectures, circuits, and novel applications of secure hardware. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical contributions from previous symposia have covered topics such as: (1) counterfeit detection and avoidance, (2) side channel analysis and fault analysis, (3) hardware architectures for cryptography, and (4) physically unclonable functions (PUFs). The travel grants encourage more students to consider a technical submission, participation in growing hardware demonstration space to a large diverse audience, or even to attend as a means to prepare for a technical submission in future years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
