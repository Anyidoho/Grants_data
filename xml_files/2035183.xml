<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support to help defray the expenses of participants in the 2020 East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium (ECOAS), which will be held on the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville, Virginia, October 17-18, 2020. The symposium expects to host between 40-60 participants, including many graduate students and postdocs. This will be the eighteenth annual meeting in the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium series. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on operator algebras (C* and von Neumann algebras) and non-commutative geometry. This year we are particularly focusing on connections to quantum information theory, quantum algebra, conformal field theory, unitary representation theory, deformation/rigidity theory, and C*-classification. The ECOAS enables participants to become acquainted with the modern developments in operator algebras, non-commutative geometry, and neighboring disciplines.  A major goal is to highlight the work of early-career researchers and facilitate them networking with other junior as well as senior researchers. More information can be found at the conference website: https://sites.google.com/view/ecoas2020uva/home?authuser=2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
