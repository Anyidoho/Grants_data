<AbstractNarration>Political trust is shaped by many factors over time, including the COVID-19 pandemic. This project will examine trust in governmental authorities and adherence to COVID-19 directives among low-income adults with childhood maltreatment histories. The project will study how various factors influence political trust and how that relates to observance of governmental instructions during the pandemic, particularly among adults with a history of child maltreatment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engaging in theories of legal attitudes, behavior, and socialization, this project will study political trust in adults who as children were removed from home in child protection actions. This longitudinal study will employ survey techniques to ascertain how this adult population adheres to government-issued directives during the COVID-19 pandemic. The project also will examine how these adults socialize their children with respect to following government mandates meant to control the pandemic. This project will provide the public with insight on both practical and theoretical levels, as it will be important for characterizing political trust and legal socialization that may affect the spread of disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
