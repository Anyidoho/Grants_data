<AbstractNarration>The need for larger numbers of people in the geosciences workforce in the United States is great. Educational experiences outside of formal school curricula have been shown to increase not only student interest in the geosciences but the number of students choosing geosciences and STEM-related professions as well. The formal and informal interactions among geoscientists from all career stages that are facilitated in conference settings comprise excellent means to reinforce students' desires to continue the study of geosciences towards careers in academia, government or industry. Student travel grants to attend the International Sedimentary Geoscience Congress in Flagstaff, Arizona allow students opportunities to connect with one another and with a diverse range of early career and established sedimentary geoscientists across disciplines and broad geographic regions. These travel awards also allow students to attend specialized workshops, short courses, and field trips that are complementary to the core scientific program of the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Sedimentary Geoscience Congress is a global meeting devoted to sedimentary geoscience and was initiated by the Society for Sedimentary Geology in cooperation with the Sedimentary Geology Division of the Geological Society of America and the International Association of Sedimentologists. The meeting in April 2020 is the first of a planned series that will convene every four years and its theme is 'The past is the key to a sustainable future'. This award is funding undergraduate and graduate students typically underrepresented in the geosciences and related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
