<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Many animals attract mates using showy behavior or characteristics to grab the attention of a potential mate. Frogs and toads are classic examples, with males producing exceptionally loud calls to attract females and defend their territory. Vocal sacs are required for males to produce these loud sounds, however, both vocal sacs and calling behavior have been lost in a number of species. This research aims to understand the evolutionary pattern and ecological correlates of the loss of a sexually selected trait. Focusing on True Toads, the Fellow will collect genetic data and 3-D scans from museum specimens to understand how loss of this sexually selected trait has affected the clade?s biodiversity. Detailed research into the evolution and biodiversity of frogs and toads is especially important due to an alarming rate of species decline and loss, ~40% are at risk, while another ~25% are still classified as having unknown status. To increase broader participation in science, the Fellow will provide accessible research opportunities to students from underrepresented groups by focusing on those with hearing and communication difficulties.&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;The evolutionary drivers and consequences of sexually selected trait loss are relatively unknown compared to trait gain, with our limited knowledge derived from a few model systems. The Fellow will test for evidence of proposed causes of vocal sac loss in True Toads, Bufonidae, and determine how the loss of this sexually selected trait affects the evolutionary trajectory of a lineage. Using comparative methods the Fellow will identify the number and distribution of vocal sac losses in Bufonidae, along with multiple traits that have been previously associated with call loss. From these data the Fellow can understand the rate and frequency that calls are lost within the Bufonidae and begin to identify what environmental and ecological factors contribute to vocal sac loss. Additionally, the Fellow will test the impact of vocal sac loss, a sexually selected trait, on diversification in this speciose family. In addition to receiving important training in microCT scanning and comparative genomics, the Fellow will engage students from underrepresented groups in hands-on work with museum specimens and provide them with comprehensive research experiences that include data collection and the use of cutting-edge genetic and morphological techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
