<AbstractNarration>The project will use simulations of dark matter structure growth over cosmological time combined with models for the growth and structure of galaxies and galaxy clusters to develop tools to use data from two dark energy surveys to better understand how dark matter clustering creates the structure we see in the universe today. The approach to be used will use emulators to produce synthetic observations from different models of galaxy clustering. These synthetic observations will be compared with observations to determine which models best reproduce the galaxy clustering seen today. The project will also support education and public outreach efforts at Ohio State University as well as continued support for the combination of art and science projects that relate to astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop analysis tools for use with data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The project will construct emulation tools for model predictions based on cosmological N-body simulations populated with galaxies according to halo occupation distribution models. The tools will be applied to three main areas: (i) measuring the evolution of dark matter clustering by combining galaxy-galaxy weak lensing with galaxy clustering; (ii) measuring the evolution of dark matter clustering by combining cluster weak lensing with projected cluster-galaxy cross-correlations and galaxy auto-correlations; and (iii) measuring mean infall velocity profiles around clusters using reshift-space distortions of the cluster galaxy cross-correlation function. The project will indirectly support a number of outreach and broadening participation efforts at Ohio State University through the involvement of the PI as chair of the Astronomy Department. The PI will be directly supporting engagement in combining art and science projects, specifically instigating a course that would teach animation students from OSU?s Advanced Computing Center for Art and Design program to create works for the immersive environment of a planetarium dome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
