<AbstractNarration>The project focuses on integrating computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) in second and third grade content classrooms, using effective research-based strategies. As the world?s economy is becoming more dependent on computers and networks, the United States is seeing a critical shortage of CS/CT workers. This shortage could be offset if the CS/CT workforce was proportionally represented by women and underserved minorities. Currently, women make up only 26% of the CS workforce and underserved minorities make up only 8%. The project will target second and third grade teachers who will create CS/CT curriculum content units for their students. Girls and underserved minorities will be a specific focus. The project will integrate CS/CT curriculum units into all second and third grade academic classes in two elementary schools. The project will provide professional development (PD) to the teachers on effective research-based strategies that have been proven to motivate and interest girls and underserved minorities in CS/CT. During the PD, the teachers will apply what they have learned to create model content curriculum units for their classrooms. They will subsequently teach the units to their students. Researchers and school district personnel will work together to maximize the practical implementation of the project so that it can be successfully scaled to other grades and districts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) project where participating teachers will develop and deploy several prototype content-based CS/CT curriculum units. Through the creation and implementation of these units, the teachers will increase their confidence and effectiveness in applying CS/CT in their content classrooms (language arts, social studies, and math). The teacher?s confidence in creating CS/CT content will be measured using pre/post self-efficacy surveys during the PD, and the teaching of the CS/CT curriculum units. They will reflect and share their experiences with each other through a Professional Learning Community (PLC). The PLC will help the teachers learn together which strategies are most effective for teaching CS/CT to their students. Additionally, a district-level Advisory Board will monitor the progress of the teachers and identify ways that the district can remove any obstacles to success. The ultimate purpose of this project is to help empower the district to continually increase the number of students who are interested in pursuing advanced CS classes and careers in CS. This project is funded by the CS for All program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
