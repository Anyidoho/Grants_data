<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the Annual Spring Institute in Noncommutative Geometry and Operator Algebras (NCGOA) to be held at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee from May 1 to 7, 2020. The topic for this workshop is Connes? embedding problem and quantum information theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last 40 years Connes' embedding problem has emerged as one of the most important problems in operator algebras. It has found equivalent versions (many of them quite unexpected) in almost all specializations within operator algebras. One notable equivalent formulations is Tsirelson?s Problem from quantum information theory. The conference will feature several mini-courses and research talks on these topics. This institute is especially timely as a solution to Connes' embedding problem has recently been announced (with a proof using techniques from quantum information theory), and the institute will provide a venue for the mathematical community to learn about, and help form a consensus as to the validity of, the announced proof.  The proposed speakers are world leaders of their fields, and it is expected that the conference will germinate new international based interactions between operator algebras and quantum information theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional information about the institute can be found on the website https://my.vanderbilt.edu/ncgoa20/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
