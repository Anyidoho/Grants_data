<AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the body of knowledge about the faculty-led research being conducted at TCUP institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tribal Nations Research Group (TNRG) will conduct a series of symposia over three years that will invite faculty and students at TCUP institutions to present the results of their original research or design projects.  TNRG will also provide consultation to student researchers on writing, presentation, and communication skills needed for scientific careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
