<AbstractNarration>Traditional software-based antivirus cannot keep up with the rapidly increasing number of cyber-attacks. This project explores approaches to improve the security of computer systems using flexible hardware techniques. It focuses on defending cyber-attacks by building a flexible hardware-based malware detection system and developing a level of immunity for computer systems against viruses through novel hardware design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to explore a viable path forward for developing future intrusion detection systems and designing secure computer systems. The detection system leverages malware features from both software and hardware and by applying advanced machine learning techniques to enhance the detection accuracy. The system is implemented with programmable hardware to achieve robust and adaptable hardware security enabling mechanism with low performance overhead for the ever-changing malware landscape. In addition, the project seeks ways to make the hardware itself more secure by providing software and architecture support for stronger isolation between applications from different security domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together research in the domains of security, computer architecture and machine learning to create a secure and trustworthy cyberspace. Additional broader impact includes the development of partnerships between our team and industry, and others (e.g., national laboratories). Potential research result transfer should help improve national security and result in increased economic competitiveness for the United States. It will also play a major role in education by integrating exploration with teaching and training, as well as making the necessary efforts to attract and train minority students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project repository will be indefinitely maintained at https://github.com/uci-pascal-satc/hardware-security/. All data will also be stored in the laboratory where the simulation and experiments are conducted.  This will be done with standard backups using computers, external disks, and various storage media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
