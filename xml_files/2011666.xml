<AbstractNarration>The 2020 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2020) is being organized by SIAM in cooperation with the American Statistical Association.  SDM 2020 will be held in Cincinnati, Ohio from May 7 to May 9, 2020. Funds will provide travel support for approximately 16 students from institutions in the United States to participate in a student consortium that is to be held as part of SDM 2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide support for student participation in a new consortium, the SIAM Student Consortium.  It will provide the students with an opportunity to learn new data skills (Python) and to participate with peers and leading researchers.  Conference leadership will provide mentors to the participants.   This is one of the first meetings to make an effort to engage undergraduates, including from underrepresented groups, and is a complement to the range of graduate doctoral consortia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
