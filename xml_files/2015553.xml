<AbstractNarration>For a period of five years, this award will enable undergraduates to present their mathematical research at the world's largest mathematics conference, the annual Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM), beginning with JMM 2021 on January 6-9, 2021 in Washington, D.C.  Presenting their work at a national conference can be a life-changing experience for undergraduate researchers, giving them the opportunity to discuss their work with peers, graduate students, and established mathematicians who share their excitement about mathematics.  Participating in the wide-ranging program of the JMM enhances their mathematical growth, increases their familiarity with the mathematics profession, and helps them develop a sense of belonging to the mathematical sciences community, thus making them more likely to pursue a mathematically based career or graduate study in the mathematical sciences.  This sense of “belonging in math” is particularly crucial for students from underrepresented groups.  By contributing to the development of a diverse and mathematically skilled workforce, this project will advance the Nation’s ability to meet current and future challenges.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Held in January each year, the JMM typically attracts more than 6000 registrants, including about 800 undergraduates. Over a five-year period, these grants will help about 940 students to present posters and papers about their research and will enable them to participate in the many other opportunities that the meeting offers, including a Graduate School Fair.  In order to be eligible for travel grants, undergraduates must be enrolled a US-based institution and must be presenting their work in either a research-focused paper session of the American Mathematical Society or in the Student Poster Session at JMM.  The latter will be organized by the Mathematical Association of America at JMM 2021, and thereafter by the mathematics honor society Pi Mu Epsilon.  The website for JMM 2021 is http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/jmm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
