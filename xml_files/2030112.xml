<AbstractNarration>In this RAPID project, a collaborative PI team intends to collect time sensitive atmospheric samples in the Los Angeles, CA, area, where historically high pollutant levels of ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have plagued public health. By taking advantage of significant reductions in atmospheric emissions associated with current COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders, a natural experiment has presented itself that allows for observations to be made under uniquely useful conditions. Results will help constrain predictive models of pollutant concentrations and guide regulatory agencies in best strategies to mitigate poor air quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaseous and particulate samples will be collected during and after the lifting of COVID-19 by co-locating sampling devices on Caltech?s established roof-top sampling platform, where continuous monitoring of essential parameters, including NOx, O3, and PM2.5, is ongoing. Focus in this study is on the detailed chemical speciation of the important precursor group of compounds denoted as volatile to intermediate volatility organic compounds (I/VOCs) containing 1 to 15 carbon atoms (C1-C15). These compounds are emitted through a number of different sources, including from fossil fuel production and burning, use of chemical products, and biological productivity. Their ill-defined sources and reactivities have been attributed to an existing gap in knowledge that could describe higher-than-expected O3 levels in megacities where precursor emissions have seen a general decrease in past decades. Here, I/VOC sources and source markers will be determined during a period when transportation associated emissions to VOCs and NOx are low. State-of-the-art analyses of collected samples at PIs? laboratories include two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCÃ—GC) with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) and a multi-column/detector GC system with 5 different types of separation and detection combinations. Results will (i) provide new insight into the intricate mechanisms of O3 and PM2.5 production under uniquely low NOx conditions and a changing mix of VOCs, and (ii) help constrain predictive models of atmospheric chemistry and air quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
