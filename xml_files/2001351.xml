<AbstractNarration>The beauty of a physical object, such as a snowflake, is often a reflection of its regularity or symmetry. In mathematics such a regularity is described by the notion of groups or algebras. This research project seeks to study a certain deformation symmetry known as i-quantum groups, which exhibit a crystal-like discrete structure, not unlike what one sees in a snowflake. The PI plans to uncover higher symmetries (in categorical or geometric approaches) behind the i-quantum groups. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The i-quantum groups arising from quantum symmetric pairs are a vast generalization of quantum groups. The PI proposes a Hall algebra construction of i-quantum groups in greater generality, and constructs braid group symmetries of i-quantum groups along the way. The PI also proposes to provide a Drinfeld type construction of i-quantum groups of affine type, which will pave the way to their finite-dimensional representations and a geometric realization via classical flag varieties and more generally quiver varieties. In addition, a theory of cells for i-quantum groups will be developed. Finally, a Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier type categorification of i-quantum groups is proposed, and it will have applications to modular representations of algebraic groups and quantum groups at roots of unity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
