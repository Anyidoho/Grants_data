<AbstractNarration>In the era of artificial intelligence and data science, covering data process and standardization, algorithm and tool development, statistics, machine learning and related approaches provide critical new opportunities for dealing with the amazing data growth rate. This coupled with new technologies leads to advances in health and biomedical research. The 2020 the International Conference on Intelligent Biology and Medicine (ICIBM) will be held August 9-11, 2020, led by a stellar field of keynote speakers to address themes of omics- and data-based systems, translational science and personalized medicine. The conference promotes extensive interaction and provides opportunities for junior faculty and students to participate and learn. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission of ICIBM is to promote information science, technology, and education to a great variety of trainees and young investigators, including trainees, faculty, teachers, scientists, and engineers, and to provide a forum for the cross-fertilization of ideas. ICIBM will provide a forum to accelerate data science method development and application, to explore complex and dynamic functions and regulation in cellular systems and organisms, and to improve algorithms, deep learning, computational tools, knowledgebase, and biotechniques for better diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases. ICIBM 2020 conference programs will include four distinguished keynote speakers, eminent scholars' talks, tutorial and workshop sessions, scientific presentations, a poster session, and other activities. Top manuscripts will be selected for special journal issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
