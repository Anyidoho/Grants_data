<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel costs for students and junior researchers to attend a summer training workshop at the University of Texas at Austin in the domain of SaTC--secure and trustworthy cyberspace. The event allows emerging scholar cohorts the opportunity to diversify the way they think about technological and data intensive research problems as well as to expand and diversify their professional networks. Participants are mentored by faculty and receive  opportunities to lay the groundwork for ongoing collaborative engagement with peers and more experienced researchers. This interdisciplinary environment creates opportunities for scholarly innovation and future leadership. This growing network will help to strengthen sociotechnical approaches to privacy, security, ethics, and data science research among colleagues in their home departments, and to their future students and colleagues&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
